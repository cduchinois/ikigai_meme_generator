Create a high-quality 3D render of a cartoon-style action figure presented in blister packaging, like a collectible toy.

Background & Packaging

Sky-blue cardstock backing with a subtle textured finish and a retro label.

At the top center, in large bold uppercase letters inside a yellow frame with a black border, display “STARTER PACK.”

Just below, in smaller text aligned to the bottom right of the frame, the name “David.”

Top right corner: a circular blue badge reading “ACTION FIGURE.”

Top left corner: a small white bubble with “4+.”

Along the right edge of the blister, a vertical yellow stripe labeled “IKIGAI” with three keywords listed vertically: “Collaboration,” “Innovation,” “Social Impact.”

Under the blister on the cardstock, three small icons illustrate his core values:

A cluster of linked silhouettes (international collaboration)

A stylized lightbulb over a circuit board pattern (open-source innovation)

A heart surrounded by child and adult silhouettes (family & social impact)

The Figure

A French man around 43 years old with light stubble, short salt-and-pepper hair.

Expression: determined yet warm, gazing toward the horizon.

Outfit: casual navy button-down shirt, dark jeans, modern white sneakers.

Pose: standing with left leg slightly forward; right arm lowered with an open hand inviting others in, left arm bent with a closed fist at his side, exuding confident leadership.

Molded Accessories

A mini open laptop showing a strategy chart and an open-source logo.

A standing conference microphone representing speaking engagements.

A stylized miniature globe on a small pedestal.
Each accessory fits into its own clear molded compartment beside the figure.

Presentation

Photograph or render blister and figure with soft shadows, even lighting, and a clean white background as if in a commercial photoshoot.

Overall style: blend of realistic and stylized 3D cartoon (Pixar-inspired)—rounded shapes, fine textures, vibrant colors.

Proportions and layout should mimic a real retail toy, balancing figure, logos, and icons harmoniously.

The design should reflect David’s ikigai: building open communities, innovating for the common good, and balancing professional success with family life.
